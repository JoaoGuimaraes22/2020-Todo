## Operators

**What is it:**

- It's a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations;
- Some operators behave differently based on the type of the operands;
- For example, there are operators of the type:
  - Arithmetic operators;
  - Assignment operators;
  - Comparison operators;
  - Equality operators;
  - Boolean logical operators;
  - Betwise and shift operators;
  - Member access operators;
  - Type-cast operators;
  - Pointer related operators;

**Arithmetic Operators:**

- Examples:
  - `+`:
    - Adds two operands;
  - `-`:
    - Subtracts second operand from the first;
  - `*`:
    - Multiplies both operands;
  - `/`:
    - Divides numerator by de-numerator;
  - `%`:
    - Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer division;
  - `++`:
    - Increment operator increases integer value by one;
  - `--`:
    - Decrement operator decreases integer value by one;

**Relational Operators:**

- Examples:
  - `==`:
    - Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true;
  - `!=`:
    - Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true;
  - `>`:
    - Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true;
  - `<`:
    - Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true;
  - `>=`:
    - Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true;
  - `<=`:
    - Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true;

**Logical Operators:**

- Examples:
  - `&&`:
    - Called Logical AND operator;
    - If both the operands are non zero (or both true) then condition becomes true;
  - `||`:
    - Called Logical OR Operator;
    - If any of the two operands is non zero (or true) then condition becomes true;
  - `!`:
    - Called Logical NOT Operator;
    - Used to reverses the logical state of its operand;
    - If a condition is true then Logical NOT operator will make false;

**Bitwise Operators:**

- Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit by bit operation, with truth tables;

**Assignment Operators:**

- `=`:
  - Assignment operator;
  - Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand;
- `+=`:
  - Add AND assignment operator;
  - It adds right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to left operand;
- `-=`:
  - Subtract AND assignment operator;
  - It subtracts right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to left operand;
- `*=`:
  - Multiply AND assignment operator;
  - It multiplies right operand with the left operand and assigns the result to left operand;
- `/=`:
  - Divide AND assignment operator;
  - It divides left operand with the right operand and assigns the result to left operand;
- `%=`:
  - Modulus AND assignment operator;
  - It takes modulus using two operands and assigns the result to left operand;
- There are more for shift and bitwise operations, less used;

**Miscellaneous Operators:**

- Examples:
  - `sizeof()`:
    - Returns the size of a data type;
  - `typeof()`:
    - Returns the type of a class;
  - `&`:
    - Returns the address of an variable;
  - `*`:
    - Pointer to a variable;
  - `? :`:
    - Conditional Expression;
  - `is`:
    - Determines whether an object is of a certain type;
  - `as`:
    - Cast without raising an exception if the cast fails;
