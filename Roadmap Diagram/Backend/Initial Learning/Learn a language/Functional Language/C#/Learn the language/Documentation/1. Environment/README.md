## The C# Environment

**The .NET framework:**

- It's a platform that helps you to write the following types of applications:
  - Windows applications;
  - Web applications;
  - Web services;

**The .NET components:**

- Language:
  - WinForms;
  - ASP.Net;
  - ADO.Net;
- Library:
  - Framework Class Library;
- CLR:
  - Common Language Runtime;
- And more in bulk like:
  - The .Net Framework Class Library;
  - Common Language Specification;
  - Common Type System;
  - Metadata and Assemblies;
  - Windows Forms;
  - ASP.Net and ASP.Net AJAX;
  - ADO.Net;
  - Windows Workflow Foundation (WF);
  - Windows Presentation Foundation;
  - Windows Communication Foundation (WCF);
  - LINQ

**Common Language Runtime (CLR):**

- The CLR or CLI is platform on which the .Net programs are executed;
- Features:
  - Exception Handling:
  - Garbage Collection:
    - The process of removing unwanted resources when they are no longer required;
  - Working with various programming languages;

**The Lifecycle:**

- The lifceycle in the .NET framework goes like so:
  - Programming Language -> Compiler -> Common Language Interpeter;

**Class Library:**

- Includes a set of standard class libraries;
- Is a collection of methods and functions that can be used for the core purpose, organized in namespaces;

**Languages:**

- WinForms:
  - For developing Forms-based applications, which would run on an end user machine;
- ASP.Net:
  - For developing web-based applications;
- ADO.Net:
  - To develop applications to interact with Databases;

**.NET Framework Design Principles:**

- Interoperability:
  - Backwards support;
  - Microsoft ensures that older framework versions gel well with the latest version;
- Portability:
  - Made to work in different platforms;
- Security:
  - The inbuilt security mechanism helps in both validation and verification of applications;
- Memory management:
  - CLR does all the work or memory management;
  - Garbage collecting;
- Simplified deployment:
  - Tools exist that can be used to package applications built on the .Net frameworK

**IDE:**

- Visual Studio:
  - Can be used to create an application in any .Net language. Hence, a developer can use C#, VB.Net or even F# to develop an application;
  - Can be used to create an application of any type;
  - Allows one to run the program at any point of time during the development process;
  - Has multiple extensions;
  - Intellisense;
  - Nuget Support;
  - Provides ALM (Application Life-cycle Management) support for different phases of the development;
