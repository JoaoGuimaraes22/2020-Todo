# Overview

## Introduction

- Database normalization is the process of structuring a relational database in accordance with a series of so-called normal forms in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity;
- Normalization entails organizing the columns (attributes) and tables (relations) of a database to ensure that their dependencies are properly enforced by database integrity constraints;
- It is accomplished by applying some formal rules either by a process of synthesis (creating a new database design) or decomposition (improving an existing database design);
