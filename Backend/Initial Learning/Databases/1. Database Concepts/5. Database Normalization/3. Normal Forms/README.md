# Normal Forms

## The Normal Forms

- The basis for normalization;
- Codd introduced the concept of normalization and what is now known as the first normal form (1NF) in 1970;
- Codd went on to define the second normal form (2NF) and third normal form (3NF) in 1971, and Codd and Raymond F. Boyce defined the Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF) in 1974;

## Normalization Steps

- The Theory of Data Normalization in SQL is still being developed further;
- **However, in most practical applications, normalization achieves its best in 3rd Normal Form**;
- The normal forms (from least normalized to most normalized) are:
  - **UNF**: Unnormalized form;
  - **1NF**: First normal form;
  - **2NF**: Second normal form;
  - **3NF**: Third normal form;
  - **EKNF**: Elementary key normal form;
  - **BCNF**: Boyceâ€“Codd normal form;
  - **4NF**: Fourth normal form;
  - **ETNF**: Essential tuple normal form;
  - **5NF**: Fifth normal form;
  - **DKNF**: Domain-key normal form;
  - **6NF**: Sixth normal form;
