# Introduction

## Overview

- ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) is a set of properties of database transactions to guarantee validity, even in the event of failures;
- In the context of databases, a sequence of database operations that satisfies the ACID properties (and these can be perceived as a single logical operation on the data) is called a transaction;
- For example, a transfer of funds from one bank account to another, even involving multiple changes such as debiting one account and crediting another, is a single transaction;
- These four properties describe the major guarantees of the transaction paradigm, which has influenced many aspects of development in database systems;

## Characteristics

- The characteristics of these four properties as defined by Reuter and HÃ¤rder are as follows:
  - Atomicity;
  - Consistency;
  - Isolation;
  - Durability;
