# Database Overview

## What is a Database

- It's an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system;
- Where databases are more complex they are often developed using formal design and modeling techniques;

## Terminology and Overview

- A "database" refers to a set of related data and the way it is organized;
- Access to this data is usually provided by a "database management system" (DBMS) consisting of an integrated set of computer software that allows users to interact with one or more databases and provides access to all of the data contained in the database (although restrictions may exist that limit access to particular data);
- Because of the close relationship between them, the term "database" is often used casually to refer to both a database and the DBMS used to manipulate it;
- Both a database and its DBMS conform to the principles of a particular database model;
- "Database system" refers collectively to the database model, database management system, and database;
- Physically, database servers are dedicated computers that hold the actual databases and run only the DBMS and related software;

## The use for Databases

- Existing DBMSs provide various functions that allow management of a database and its data which can be classified into four main functional groups:

### Data definition

- For the creation, modification and removal of definitions that define the organization of the data;

### Update

- Insertion, modification, and deletion of the actual data;

### Retrieval

- Providing information in a form directly usable or for further processing by other applications;
- The retrieved data may be made available in a form basically the same as it is stored in the database or in a new form obtained by altering or combining existing data from the database;

### Administration

- Registering and monitoring users, enforcing data security, monitoring performance, maintaining data integrity, dealing with concurrency control, and recovering information that has been corrupted by some event such as an unexpected system failure;

## Diferent Databases

- Databases and DBMSs can be categorized according to the database model(s) that they support (such as relational or XML), the type(s) of computer they run on (from a server cluster to a mobile phone), the query language(s) used to access the database (such as SQL or XQuery), and their internal engineering, which affects performance, scalability, resilience, and security;
