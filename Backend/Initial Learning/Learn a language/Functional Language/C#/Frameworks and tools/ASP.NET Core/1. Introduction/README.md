# Introduction

## Overview

- ASP.NET Core is a free, open-source and cloud optimized web framework which can run on Windows, Linux, or Mac;
- Modular and cross-platform;

## How to use

- ASP.NET Core is a modular framework distributed as NuGet packages;
- This allows us to include packages that are required in our application;
- Runs on .NET Core and on the .NET Framework;

## What can you build

- ASP.NET Core is designed to be deployed on cloud as well as on-premises;
- You can build cloud-based web apps, IoT and mobile backend applications;

## .NET Core

- ASP.NET Core and .NET Core are not the same;
- .NET Core is a fast, lightweight, modular and open source framework for creating web applications and services that run on Windows, Linux and Mac;
- It's a platform on which ASP.NET Core application runs;

## .NET Core Components

- The .NET Compiler platform Rosly;
- The runtime CoreCLR;
- .NET Core Framework CoreFX;

## ASP.NET Core Advantages

### Supports Multiple Platforms

- ASP.NET Core applications can run on Windows, Linux, and Mac;
- So you don't need to build different apps for different platforms using different frameworks;

### Fast

- ASP.NET Core no longer depends on System.Web.dll for browser-server communication;
- ASP.NET Core allows us to include packages which we need for our application;
- This reduces the request pipeline and improves the performance and scalability;

### IoC Container

- It includes built-in IoC container for automatic dependency injection which makes it maintainable and testable;

### Integration with Moder UI Frameworks

- It allows you to use and manage modern UI frameworks such as AngularJS, ReactJS, Umber, Bootstrap etc. using Bower (a package manager for the web);

### Hosting

- ASP.NET Core web application can be hosted on multiple platforms with any web server such as IIS, Apache etc;

### Code Sharing

- It allows you to build a class library which can be used with other .NET frameworks such as .NET Framework 4.x or Mono;
- Thus a single code based can be shared across frameworks;

### Side-by-Side App Versioning

- ASP.NET Core runs on .NET Core which supports simultaneous running of multiple versions of applications;

### Smaller Deployment Footprint

- ASP.NET Core application runs on .NET Core which is smaller than full .NET Framework;
- So, the application which uses only a part of .NET CoreFX will have smaller deployment size;
- This reduces the deployment foot print;
