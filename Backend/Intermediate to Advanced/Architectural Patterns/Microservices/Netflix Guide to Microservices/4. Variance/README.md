# Variance

- Operational Drift;
- Polyglot and containers;

## Operational Drift

- It's unitentional variance;
- Over time, these may vary:
  - Alert thresholds;
  - Timeouts, retries, fallbacks;
  - Throughput (RPS);
  - Across microservices:
    - Reliability best practices;

### Solving Operational Drift

- Through learning and automation;
- Tackling incidents through:
  - Resolution -> Review -> Remediation -> Analysis -> Best Practises -> Automation -> Adoption;
- You should have production ready guidelines, ex: consistent naming, autoscaling, etc.;

## Polyglot and Containers

- Have separation of concerns through containers;

### Cost of variance

- Productivity tooling;
- Insight & triage tooling;
- Base image fragmentation;
- Node management;
- Library/platform duplication;
- Learning curve - production expertise;

## Have a Strategic Stance

- Raise awareness of costs;
- Constrain centralized support;
- Prioritize by impact;
- Seek reusable solutions;
