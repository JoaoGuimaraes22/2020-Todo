# Introduction

## What is the Microservice architectural style

- It's an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API;

## Microservices as an evolutionary response

- Separation of concerns:
  - Modularity;
  - Encapsulation;
- Scalability:
  - Horizontal scaling;
  - Workload partitioning;
- Virtualization & Elasticity:
  - Automated operations;
  - On demand provisioning;
