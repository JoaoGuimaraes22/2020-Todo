**What is version control**

- The management of changes to documents, programs and other collections of informations;

**What does it allow:**

- Allows you to compare changes over time;
- Allows you to see who last modified something that might be causing a problem;
- Allows you to see who introduced an issue and when;

**Version Control Concepts:**

- Repository:
  - The heart of any version control system;
  - The place where all the developers store their code;
  - Maintain the history;
  - Accessed over a network which acts like a server and version control tool as a client;
- Trunk:
  - Directory where all the development takes place;
- Tags:
  - Help create snapshots of the project;
  - Allows to keep descriptive and memorable names to specific version in the repository;
- Branches:
  - Branches of the repository are like branches of the tree;
  - Are used to create another like of development;
- Working Copy:
  - The snapshot of the repository where the developer is actively working on it;
- Commits:
  - Committing code is the process of storing changes from working copy to the central server;

**Conclusion:**

- If you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover;
- In addition, you get all this for very little overhead;
- Allows for better team development;
