#### The General Knowledge Route

- My opinion;
- Here you will find the info that every developer should a little bit about;
- This is the where you should start to learn, even before learning any programming;
- This is not to be done completely before starting any other section;
- Learn these concepts gradually, while learning about the other non-general concepts in the other routes;
