## Arrays

**Overview:**

- Stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type;
- Used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type stored at contiguous memory locations;

**Declaring arrays:**

- Syntax:
  - `datatype[] arrayName;`;
  - Where:
    - `datatype` is used to specify the type of elements in the array;
    - `[]` specifies the rank of the array, which specifies its size;
    - `arrayName` specifies the name of the array;
