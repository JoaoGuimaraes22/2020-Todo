# Artifacts

## Overview

- Are the backlogs and tasks registered;

## Product Backlog

- It's a breakdown of work to be done;
- Contains an ordered list of product requirements;
- Include user stories and use cases;
- The requirements define features, bug fixes, non-functional requirements;
- Items are prioritized based on risk, business value, dependencies, size, and date needed;
- It's what will be delivered, ordered into the sequence in which it should be delivered;
- May only be changed with the consent of the product owner, responsible for ordering;
- Contains the product owner's assessment of business value and the development team's assessment of development effort, which are often, but not always, stated in story points using the rounded Fibonacci scale;
- The product backlog and the business value of each product backlog item is the responsibility of the product owner;
- The effort to deliver each item is estimated by the development team in story points, or time;
- By estimating in story points, the team reduces the dependency in individual developers;
- Story points define the effort in a time-box;
- The gap progression between the terms in the Fibonacci sequence encourages the team to deliver carefully considered estimates;
- The value of using story points is that the team can reuse them by comparing similar work from previous sprints, but it should be recognized that estimates are relative to the team;
- The product backlog:
  - Captures requests to modify a productâ€”including new features, replacing old features, removing features, and fixing issues;
  - Ensures the development team has work that maximizes business benefit to the product owner;

## Management

- Having well-established rules about how work is added, removed and ordered helps the whole team make better decisions about how to change the product;
- The product owner prioritizes product backlog items based on which are needed soonest;
- The team then chooses which items they can complete in the coming sprint;
- On the scrum board, the team moves items from the product backlog to the sprint backlog, which is the list of items they will build;
- It's ideal for the team to only select what they think they can accomplish from the top of the list;
- Items at the top of the backlog, the items to work on first, should be broken down into stories that are suitable for the development team to work on;
- As the team works through the backlog, it must be assumed that change happens outside their environment;
- All of these new ideas tend to trigger the team to adapt the backlog to incorporate new knowledge, which is part of the fundamental mindset of an agile team;

## Sprint Backlog

- It's the list of work the development team must address during the next sprint;
- The list is derived by the scrum team progressively selecting product backlog items in priority order from the top of the product backlog until they feel they have enough work to fill the sprint;
- The product backlog items may be broken down into tasks by the development team;
- Tasks on the sprint backlog are never assigned (or pushed) to team members by someone else; rather team members sign up for (or pull) tasks as needed according to the backlog priority and their own skills and capacity;
- The sprint backlog is the property of the development team, and all included estimates are provided by the development team;
- Once a sprint backlog is committed, no additional work can be added to the sprint backlog except by the team;
- Once a sprint has been delivered, the product backlog is analyzed and reprioritized if necessary, and the next set of functionality is selected for the next sprint;

## Increment

- It's the potentially releasable output of the sprint that meets the sprint goal;
- Formed from all the completed sprint backlog items, integrated with the work of all previous sprints;
- The increment must be complete, according to the scrum team's definition of done (DoD), fully functioning, and in a usable condition regardless of whether the product owner decides to actually deploy and use it;
