# Workflow

## Overview

- ThereÂ´s a specific Agile workflow;

## Sprint

- It's the basic unit of development in Scrum;
- It's a timeboxed effort, that is, the length is agreed and fixed in advance for each sprint and is normally between one week and one month, with two weeks being the most common;
- Each sprint starts with a sprint planning event that establishes a sprint goal and the required product backlog items;
- The team accepts what they agree is ready and translate this into a sprint backlog, with a breakdown of the work required and an estimated forecast for the sprint goal;
- Each sprint ends with a sprint review and sprint retrospective, that reviews progress to show to stakeholders and identify lessons and improvements for the next sprints;

## Sprint planning steps

- Mutually discuss and agree on the scope of work that is intended to be done during that sprint;
- Select product backlog items that can be completed in one sprint;
- Prepare a sprint backlog that includes the work needed to complete the selected product backlog items;
- Agree the **sprint goal**, a short description of what they are forecasting to deliver at the end of the sprint;

### Sprint duration

- The recommended duration is four hours for a two-week sprint:
  - During the first half, the whole scrum team (development team, scrum master, and product owner) selects the product backlog items they believe could be completed in that sprint;
  - During the second half, the development team identifies the detailed work (tasks) required to complete those product backlog items; resulting in a confirmed sprint backlog;
    - As the detailed work is elaborated, some product backlog items may be split or put back into the product backlog if the team no longer believes they can complete the required work in a single sprint;

### Sprint Forecast

- Once the development team has prepared their sprint backlog, they forecast (usually by voting) which tasks will be delivered within the sprint;

## Daily Scrum Guidelines

- All members of the development team come prepared. The daily scrum:
  - starts precisely on time even if some development team members are missing;
  - should happen at the same time and place every day;
  - is limited (timeboxed) to fifteen minutes;
- Anyone is welcome, though only development team members should contribute;

### Scrum Questions

- During the daily scrum, each team member typically answers three questions:
  - What did I complete yesterday that contributed to the team meeting our sprint goal?;
  - What do I plan to complete today to contribute to the team meeting our sprint goal?;
  - Do I see any impediment that could prevent me or the team from meeting our sprint goal?;

### Scrum Exceptions

- Any impediment identified in the daily scrum should be captured by the scrum master and displayed on the team's scrum board or on a shared risk board, with an agreed person designated to working toward a resolution;

## Sprint review

- At the end of a sprint, the team holds two events: the sprint review and the sprint retrospective;
- At the sprint review, the team:
  - reviews the work that was completed and the planned work that was not completed;
  - presents the completed work to the stakeholders (aka the demo);
  - collaborates with the stakeholders on what to work on next;

### Guidelines for sprint reviews

- Incomplete work cannot be demonstrated;
- The recommended duration is two hours for a two-week sprint;

## Sprint Retrospective Tasks

- Reflection on the past sprint;
- Identification and agreement on continuous improvement actions;

### Guidelines for sprint retrospectives

- Three main questions are asked in the sprint retrospective: What went well during the sprint? What did not go well? What could be improved for better productivity in the next sprint?;
- The recommended duration is one-and-a-half hours for a two-week sprint (proportional for other sprint duration(s));
- This event is facilitated by the scrum master;

## Backlog refinement

- It's the ongoing process of reviewing product backlog items and checking that they are appropriately prepared and ordered in a way that makes them clear and executable for teams once they enter sprints via the sprint planning activity;
- Items may broken down into smaller parts;
- Acceptance criteria are clarified;
- Dependencies are identified and investigated;
- Can also include technical debt;
- Reflects the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer;

## Cancelling a sprint

- The product owner may do so with input from the team, scrum master or management;
- If a sprint is abnormally terminated, the next step is to conduct a new sprint planning, where the reason for the termination is reviewed;
