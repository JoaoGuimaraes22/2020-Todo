# IDEs

## Overview

- They are integrated software environments, software applications that provide comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development;

## May Contain

### Syntax Highlighting

- The IDE editor usually provides syntax highlighting, it can show both the structures, the language keywords and the syntax errors with visually distinct colors and font effects;

### Code Completion

- Code completion is an important IDE feature, intended to speed up programming;
- Modern IDEs even have intelligent code completion;

### Refactoring

- Advanced IDEs provide support for automated refactoring;

### Version Control

- An IDE is expected to provide integrated version control, in order to interact with source repositories;

### Debugging

- IDEs are used for debugging, using an integrated debugger, with support for setting breakpoints in the editor, visual rendering of steps, etc;

### Code Search

- IDEs may provide advanced support for code search: in order to find class and function declarations, usages, variable and field read/write, etc.;
- IDEs can use different kinds of user interface for code search, for example form-based widgets[5] and natural-language based interfaces;

### Visual Programming

- Visual programming is a usage scenario in which an IDE is generally required;
- For example, Visual Basic allows users to create new applications by moving programming, building blocks, or code nodes to create flowcharts or structure diagrams that are then compiled or interpreted;

### Language Support

- Some IDEs support multiple languages, or contain plugins to support multiple languages;

### Attitude across computing platforms

- Some IDEs allow for development in a certain langugae to be done in any computing platform;

### Artifical Intelligence

- Some features of IDEs can benefit from advances in AI;
- In particular, one can collect information from IDE actions across developers in order to augment IDE features;
- For instance, a data-driven approach to code completion results in intelligent code completion

### Web Integrated Development

- A Web IDE is a browser based IDE that allows for software development or web development accesed throught the browser, allowing for a portable work environment;

## Should you use an IDE

- Using an IDE is not required for learning a language;
- In my opinion, you should use a code editor or an IDE, but only when you already know the basics of the lnmguage you're developing in;
- After learning the basics, you can optionally use an IDE, or not;

## My IDEs / IDEs I use

- Visual Studio:
  - Only really use it for .NET / C# development;
  - Although, nowadays I actually use Visual Studio Code for .NET Development;
