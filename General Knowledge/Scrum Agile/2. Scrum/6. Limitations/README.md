# Limitations

## Overview

- The benefits of Scrum may be more difficult to achieve in some situations;

## When members are geographically dispersed or part-time

- Developers should have close and ongoing interaction, ideally working together in the same space most of the time;

## Members with very specialized skills

- Developers should have T-shaped skills, allowing them to work on tasks outside of their specialization;
- This can be encouraged by good Scrum leadership;

## Products with many external dependencies

- Dividing product development into short sprints requires careful planning; external dependencies, such as user acceptance testing or coordination with other teams, can lead to delays and the failure of individual sprints;

## Products that are mature or legacy or with regulated quality control

- Product increments should be fully developed and tested in a single sprint; products that need large amounts of regression testing or safety testing for each release are less suited to short sprints than to longer waterfall releases;
