# Introduction

## Overview

- Scrum is an agile process framework for managing complex knowledge work;
- Designed for teams of ten or fewer members, who break their work into goals that can be completed within timeboxed iterations, called sprints, no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks, then track progress and re-plan in 15-minute time-boxed daily meetings, called daily scrums

## Key Ideas

- Scrum is a lightweight, iterative and incremental framework for managing complex work;
- Enables teams to self-organize by encouraging physical co-location or close online collaboration of all team members, as well as daily face-to-face communication among all team members and disciplines involved;
- A key principle of Scrum is the dual recognition that customers will change their minds about what they want or need and that there will be unpredictable challengesâ€”for which a predictive or planned approach is not suited;
