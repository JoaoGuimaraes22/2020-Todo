# Artiact Extensions

## Overview

- The following artifacts and techniques can be used to help people use Scrum;

## Sprint Burndown Chart

- Is a publicly displayed chart showing remaining work in the sprint backlog;
- Updated every day, it gives a simple view of the sprint progress;
- Provides quick visualizations for reference;
- The horizontal axis of the sprint burndown chart shows the days in a sprint, while the vertical axis shows the amount of work remaining each day;
- During sprint planning, the ideal burndown chart is plotted;
- Then, during the sprint, each member picks up tasks from the sprint backlog and works on them;
- At the end of the day, they update the remaining hours for tasks to be completed;
- Example:

## Release burn-up chart

- It's a way for the team to provide visibility and track progress toward a release;
- Updated at the end of each sprint, it shows progress toward delivering a forecast scope;
- The horizontal axis of the release burn-up chart shows the sprints in a release, while the vertical axis shows the amount of work completed at the end of each sprint (typically trough story points);
- Progress is plotted as a line that grows up to meet a horizontal line that represents the forecast scope; often shown with a forecast, based on progress to date, that indicates how much scope might be completed by a given release date or how many sprints it will take to complete the given scope;
- Example:

## Definition of ready (DoR)

- The start criteria to determine whether the specifications and inputs are set enough to start the work item, i.e. a user story;

## Definition of done (DoD)

- The exit-criteria to determine whether a product backlog item is complete;
- In many cases, the DoD requires that all regression tests be successful;
- The definition of done may vary from one scrum team to another but must be consistent within one team;

## Velocity

- The total effort a team is capable of in a sprint;
- The number is derived by evaluating the work (typically in user story points) completed in the last sprint;
- The collection of historical velocity data is a guideline for assisting the team in understanding how much work they can likely achieve in a future sprint;

## Spike

- A time-boxed period used to research a concept or create a simple prototype;
- Spikes can either be planned to take place in between sprints or, for larger teams, a spike might be accepted as one of many sprint delivery objectives;
- Spikes are often introduced before the delivery of large or complex product backlog items in order to secure budget, expand knowledge, or produce a proof of concept;

## Tracer bullet

- It's a spike with the current architecture, current technology set, current set of best practices that result in production quality code;
- It is of production quality, and the rest of the iterations can build on this code;
- Often these implementations are a 'quick shot' through all layers of an application, such as connecting a single form's input field to the back-end, to prove the layers connect as expected;
